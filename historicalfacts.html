<h1>Historical Facts</h1>
<p> 
In both the past and present, women are expected to be clean and being messy means that they are not worth forgiving. Although men spend time working and providing, women have to clean in the house. This dates all the way back to the 1900's. History does repeat itself and we can see that women and men are still not being treated equally.

<ol> 19th and early 20th century <ol>
<ol> World War 1: 1914-1918 </ol>
<ol> World War 2: 1939-1945 </ol>
<p>
For the 19th and early 20th century, women in England are forced to stay and work in their household to support their families. Work in the household included cleaning, working in factories, doing laundry, and making garments. Women were thought of as being second proirity to being paid after men. Even if women did want to work outside of their household, they were not allowed to because they had to support their families.
</p>
<p>
For World War 1, men were originally fighting the war. Women felt as if they wanted to contribute to the war, so a group of women were recruited. There was a lot of hesitation and resistance towards women fighting because it was seen as a 'man's job.'
<p>
For world War 2, women continued to work in factories and built planes and ships. As the war continued, there were arguements about equal pay between men and women. In the end, women did not pay and thwir pay was an average of 53% of the money that the men were getting while they were fighting in the war.
</p>
<p>
As I mentioned before, history does repeast itself. Right now, especially in this century, women feel insecure. They feel the need to stay at home cleaning while men work. What if women want to work but can't? What if a woman's husband harrasses them verbally. Women feel vulnerable. Equality for both genders.
