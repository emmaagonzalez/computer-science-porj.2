<h1>Social Justice</h1>

<p> 
 It is unfair how men are seen as having more power or that they are stronger or more capable of doing something simply because of their gender. Gender does not define how society sees you, we are all still human and should therefore be treated the same. Women are not weaker, but we do think different ways compared to men.

Segregation: Yes, men and women usually work in different jobs. This is what has been happening for a long time. Women work for shorter hours compared to men, this is called "time segregation." The most segregrated thing about women is staying home. There are many women that would rather not stay home, but they may feel inclined to because no one else will.
</p>
<p> 
Sexual Assaults: Women are taught to be "lady-like." In reality, most women feel vulnerable to their body and who they are. One in five women will be raped in their life. This is a issue because we must make women feel like they shouldn't be scared of men or everything around them. Our bodies are our home, it's our safe place.

<p>
Women in the economy: Everywhere, men tend to get paid more than women. For every dollar a man earns, women only make 49 cents of that dollar. Women can still work the same amountas men, and men will still get payed more. This can be represented through the gender pay gap shown below.
