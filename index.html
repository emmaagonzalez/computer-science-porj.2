<div class="box-a">Hello, my name is Emma Gonzalez. I am a female, just like many other females around me, I feel like I am often compared to the men around me. In my following webpages, I will discuss how the past plays a big role in gender inequality and how it also affects the present. It is unfair how men are seen as having more power or that they are stronger or more capable of doing something simply because of their gender. Gender does not define how society sees you, we are all still human and should therefore be treated the same. As society expands and only grows, you can see that people are acting different and like different things, but it is because we are living in many different generations. Regardless of what year you are living, women will always be looked as different compared to men. Why can't we all be the same? We are all humans, we all have a heart, a brain, an actual body, and soul.

<div class="box-c">In the page after this one, I will first go into the social justice aspects of Women's Rights. In the third page, I will discuss the historial facts. Finally, in the last webpage, I will discuss why this is a problem and what the solution is and how others can take action towards this. Something as little as particpating in a protest or simply telling people you know about women's rights and the big inequality difference between men and women can help the world greatly. You can make a difference. You can impact a persons life and view about this injustice, you can be the one to help diffuse this awareness. Women need to support and help each other as a community. The world that we are living in right now can be hard and challenging, it doesn't help when there are differences in this world between men and women.</div>
<div class="box-d">To find out more about women's rights and how both men band women should be treated equally, click on the links with the webpages above. Enjoy. And remember, you can make a difference between how people view women's right and the inequality bewteen men and women.</div>
